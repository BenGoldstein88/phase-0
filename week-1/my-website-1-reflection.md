Describe what open source means.

Open source means the source code is open - anyone can fork the repository and fiddle with it without necessarily affecting other peoples' versions.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

From an educational/humanitarian standpoint, it's fantastic. From an IP standpoint, it's terrifying. My feelings about it are mostly positive, however.

Assess the importance of using licenses.

Protecting your IP is crucial. Licensing is a good call.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

Dealing with git on the commandline, pushing/committing/etc. Sometimes i forgot to open a new branch :(

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Google if there was a syntax query.

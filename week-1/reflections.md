# 1.1 Think About Time
Time management boils down to scheduling and mindfulness. Embracing a working balance, pre-planning breaks, starting with small steps, and creating/maintaining good habits are essential. Time boxing involves working on something for a specific amount of time (as opposed to, say, until it's done) and can be useful in cracking away at tougher challenges. Currently, I manage my time pretty poorly so this will be good training. Maintaining good habits and a positive mindset will help with the workload at DBC. My overall plan for Phase 0 management is to do something every day while employing some versions of these management skills.

# 1.1 Think About Time
Time management boils down to scheduling and mindfulness. Embracing a working balance, pre-planning breaks, starting with small steps, and creating/maintaining good habits are essential. Time boxing involves working on something for a specific amount of time (as opposed to, say, until it's done) and can be useful in cracking away at tougher challenges. Currently, I manage my time pretty poorly so this will be good training. Maintaining good habits and a positive mindset will help with the workload at DBC. My overall plan for Phase 0 management is to do something every day while employing some versions of these management skills.

# 1.2 The Command Line


A shell lets you navigate a computing space with minimal visual cues. Bash is a particular Unix shell. I'm having to re-remember, relearn, and just regular learn a lot of these commands, but the flow is coming back slowly. Commands that move and open directories are somewhat less useful in this world of click-and-drag technology, but many that let you change file contents/metadata directly are useful and efficient.





pwd - print working

ls - list

mv - move

cd - change directory

../ -

touch - update date

mkdir - make directory

less - show less

rmdir - remove directory

rm - remove

help - get help
